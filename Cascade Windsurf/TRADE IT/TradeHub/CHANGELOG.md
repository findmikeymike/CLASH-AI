# TradeHub Development Changelog

This file tracks significant updates, development context, and technical details for the TradeHub system.

## Latest Updates

### March 23, 2025

#### [pending] - test: Validate breaker block detection with real market data
- **Context**: Tested breaker block detection logic using historical market data from multiple sources
- **Key Changes**:
  - Created multiple test scripts for breaker block validation:
    - `breaker_block_standalone_test.py`: Initial algorithm test with synthetic data
    - `breaker_block_simple_test.py`: Simplified test with real historical data
    - `breaker_block_real_data_test.py`: Comprehensive test with visualization
    - `breaker_block_multi_timeframe_test.py`: Multi-timeframe tests to estimate setup frequency
  - Verified algorithm detects both bullish and bearish breaker blocks
  - Validated expected setup frequency across different timeframes
  - Confirmed integration readiness with IBKR data feeds

#### [a08e82d2] - feat: Integrate enhanced breaker block detection with ICT methodology and advanced setup scanning
- **Context**: Enhanced the breaker block agent with ICT-based methodology
- **Key Changes**:
  - Implemented BreakerBlockAgent class that inherits from BaseAgent
  - Added support for detecting liquidity sweeps, fair value gaps (FVG), and breaker point reversals
  - Integrated nuclear logging for comprehensive debugging
  - Maintained compatibility with existing agent framework
  - Setup detection follows same pattern as sweep engulfing for consistency

#### [a1652d72] - fix: Remove stop loss and target from API response only
- **Context**: Modified dashboard API response to exclude stop loss and target prices
- **Key Changes**:
  - Updated API.py to filter out stop loss and target data
  - Preserved internal calculation logic
  - Ensured patterns are still detected and displayed correctly

#### [06a159ac] - feat: Implement breaker block pattern detection
- **Context**: Added breaker block pattern detection logic
- **Key Changes**:
  - Created new detection algorithm for identifying broken support/resistance
  - Added tracking for breaker block formations
  - Implemented ICT-based methodologies for setup identification

#### [59d8a087] - fix+feat: Fix IBKR aggregator error and add auto-cleanup for old setups
- **Context**: Resolved issues with IBKR connector and improved system maintenance
- **Key Changes**:
  - Fixed error handling in IBKR aggregator
  - Added automatic cleanup routine for old setup data
  - Improved system stability during long operation periods

#### [ea62d553] - feat: Add IBKR Aggregator Service with automatic reconnection, state persistence, and sweep engulfing pattern detection
- **Context**: Implemented robust IBKR market data connection
- **Key Changes**:
  - Added automatic reconnection to IBKR when connection is lost
  - Implemented state persistence to maintain data during restarts
  - Integrated sweep engulfing pattern detection

#### [a7a11fc2] - feat: Update ticker watchlist with new symbols
- **Context**: Expanded market coverage with additional symbols
- **Key Changes**:
  - Added new tickers to watchlist for scanning
  - Ensured system compatibility with expanded symbol list

## Pattern Detection Implementation

### Sweep Engulfing Pattern
- **Detection Logic**: Identifies when price sweeps a significant level and then engulfs previous candle
- **Bullish Pattern**: Sweeps below previous low, then closes above previous body high
- **Bearish Pattern**: Sweeps above previous high, then closes below previous body low
- **Files**: 
  - `sweep_engulfer_agent.py` - Core pattern detection
  - `trading_agents/setup_observers/sweep_engulfing_observer.py` - Setup monitoring

### Breaker Block Pattern
- **Detection Logic**: Identifies when former support/resistance are broken and later retested
- **Components**:
  - Liquidity Sweeps: Price moving beyond key levels to trigger stops
  - Fair Value Gaps (FVG): Imbalances in price action showing significant buying/selling pressure
  - Breaker Point Reversals (BPR): Points where broken levels are retested for potential reversals
- **Files**:
  - `trading_agents/agents/breaker_block_agent.py` - Implementation with ICT methodology

## Dashboard Integration

- **TradingView Charts**: Custom implementation in feed.js that initializes charts for all setup cards
- **Setup Details**: Modified to ensure consistent data between cards and detail views
- **Mock Data**: Enhanced to provide realistic pattern examples when live data is unavailable

## System Architecture

### Agent System
- All trading agents inherit from `BaseAgent` class
- Agents are automatically registered with the system
- Processing follows validate â†’ process pattern for all market data

### Scanner System
- Continuously monitors markets across timeframes
- Identifies setups based on specific patterns
- Uses data aggregator to combine and normalize price data

### Data Sources
- Interactive Brokers (IBKR): Primary data source with automatic reconnection
- Alpaca: Secondary data source when available
- Yahoo Finance: Fallback for historical data

### Dashboard
- Flask-based web interface for viewing and managing setups
- Real-time updates of detected patterns
- TradingView chart integration for visual analysis

## Development Roadmap

- [ ] Implement additional pattern detection agents
- [ ] Enhance back-testing capabilities
- [ ] Add portfolio management features
- [ ] Improve risk management algorithms
